# My-first-Repository-
This is a somewhat long but simple mini project in C programming language. Hospital management system project is just a console application without graphics, designed for Alka Hospital, situated in Lalitpur, Nepal. This project mainly uses file handling to perform basic operations like how to add, edit, search and delete record using file. The source code of hospital management system is over 1100 lines..Also, it is username and password protected. The password to enter this system is “admin” and username for this system is “12345” (all with lower case). Hence, this project is just like real Hospital Management software with all basic features. It doesn’t consist of high graphics, it is the simple one and users can understand very easily.
